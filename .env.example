# Supabase Configuration Example
# ================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# Get these values from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sublzjeyxfaxiekacfme/settings/api

# ===== FRONTEND CONFIGURATION (Safe - used in browser) =====

# Project ID
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="sublzjeyxfaxiekacfme"

# Anon (Public) Key - ✅ SAFE to use in frontend
# This key is designed to be public and is protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
# All database access is validated server-side with RLS policies
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-anon-public-key-here"

# Project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://sublzjeyxfaxiekacfme.supabase.co"

# ===== BACKEND CONFIGURATION (Dangerous - server-side only) =====

# 🚨 SERVICE ROLE KEY - EXTREME DANGER! 🚨
# This key bypasses ALL Row Level Security policies and has complete database access
# 
# ❌ NEVER use in frontend code
# ❌ NEVER commit to Git
# ❌ NEVER expose in client-side JavaScript
# ❌ NEVER share publicly
#
# ✅ ONLY use in:
#    - Edge Functions (set via: supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="...")
#    - Local backend scripts (in .env file, which is gitignored)
#    - CI/CD pipelines (as encrypted secrets)
#
# If this key is compromised, an attacker can read/write/delete ALL data!
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key-here"

# ===== IMPORTANT NOTES =====
# 
# 1. The .env file is gitignored and will NOT be committed
# 2. For Edge Functions, set secrets using: supabase secrets set KEY="value"
# 3. For production deployments, use platform environment variables
# 4. See docs/SECURITY.md for detailed security information
#
# ⚠️ DO NOT commit the actual .env file - it contains the service_role key!
